// spread operator(...z)
let x = (...z) => {
  let ans = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < z.length; i++) {
    ans += z[i];
  }
  return ans;
};

let y = x(10, 23, 34, 54, 31);
console.log(y);

/* Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```javascript
   let x = (...z) => {
     // function body
   };
   ```
   Here, a function named `x` is defined using arrow function syntax. The function accepts a variable number of arguments using the rest parameter syntax (`...z`). This means that all the arguments passed to this function will be collected into an array called `z`.

2. **Initializing Sum**:
   ```javascript
   let ans = 0;
   ```
   Inside the function, a variable `ans` is initialized with a value of 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of all the arguments.

3. **Loop through Arguments**:
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < z.length; i++) {
     ans += z[i];
   }
   ```
   This `for` loop iterates over each element of the `z` array (which contains all the arguments passed to the function). It starts from 0 and continues until `i` is less than the length of the `z` array. In each iteration, it adds the value of the current element of `z` to the `ans` variable.

4. **Return Sum**:
   ```javascript
   return ans;
   ```
   After the loop completes, the function returns the final value stored in the `ans` variable, which represents the sum of all the arguments passed to the function.

5. **Function Invocation**:
   ```javascript
   let y = x(10, 23, 34, 54, 31);
   ```
   Here, the function `x` is invoked with five arguments: 10, 23, 34, 54, and 31. These arguments are passed to the function and collected into the `z` array.

6. **Logging Result**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(y);
   ```
   Finally, the value returned by the function (the sum of the arguments) is logged to the console.

So, when you run this code, it will output the sum of all the arguments passed to the function `x`, which in this case is 10 + 23 + 34 + 54 + 31 = 152.
----------------------------

spread operator:
The spread operator (`...`) in JavaScript expands arrays or objects into individual elements or key-value pairs, respectively. It's useful for passing multiple arguments to functions, concatenating arrays, and merging objects.

the spread operator helps you work with lists of things more easily by unpacking them or combining them when needed.
