<!--
    async function getData(): This line declares an asynchronous function named getData(). The async keyword is used to define a function that will operate asynchronously, meaning it won't block the execution of other code while it's running. Asynchronous functions can contain await expressions.
let url = await fetch(...): Inside the getData() function, there's an await expression used with the fetch() function. The fetch() function is used to make an HTTP request to the specified URL ("https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json..."). By using await, the execution of the getData() function will pause until the fetch() operation is completed and a response is received. The response is stored in the url variable.
console.log(url): Once the fetch() operation is completed and the response is received, the code resumes execution, and the response (typically a Response object) is logged to the console using console.log().
getData(): Finally, the getData() function is called, initiating the asynchronous operation.
In summary, this code asynchronously fetches data from the specified URL using the Fetch API. The async and await keywords are used to work with promises in a more synchronous-like manner, making the code easier to read and maintain.
